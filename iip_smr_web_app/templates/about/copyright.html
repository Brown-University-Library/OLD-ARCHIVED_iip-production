                <p>
                   The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine (IIP) project follows a long tradition of reprinting scholarly editions of epigraphical material with appropriate attributions. Our policy of using copyrighted material does not appreciably differ from that of the Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum and other collections of inscriptions. We use other copyrighted material (e.g., images and maps) only with permissions. We further enhance the value of epigraphical data by correcting obvious mistakes, tagging content, and allowing inscriptions to appear in new and dynamic ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In compiling this collection, we have observed the guidelines of fair use as laid out in Section 107 of the U.S. copyright law. This section stipulates certain restrictions based on the following considerations:

                    <ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
                        <li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes</li>
                        <li>The nature of the copyrighted work</li>
                        <li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>
                        <li>The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All sources of inscription data are attributed, and users are urged to consult these original sources and to attribute them appropriately. For a relevant legal argument regarding the copyright of reconstructed ancient texts, see David Nimmer, "Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls: Authorship and Originality," Houston Law Review 38 (2001).

                    The copyright for all scholarly contributions remain with the contributors. By publishing their contribution in our repository, however, they assign to IIP a non-exclusive and permanent right to display their materials and rights to any work IIP staff contributed unless otherwise specified.
